## Rubric

Each question is worth two points: 

* Data plotted as described by the question (1 pt)
* Plot contains required elements (title, axis labels, axis titles, legend if required)

See below for questions answered in this repository: 

## Question 1

Given the text below, create a bar plot (or a horizontal bar plot) that shows the frequency distribution of characters in   the string.
A dictionary has been created for you containing the characters and the frequencies of the characters. Make sure your bar plot has the bars labelled correctly (with the character it represents the frequency of).

## Question 2

Generate a sequence of at least 5 random numbers (integers are fine), and visualize the data using both scatter and plot on different axes. You may use the index of the value as its x value in the plot.

## Question 3

Do the same question as above, but change the syle and color of both the scatter and the plot.

## Question 4

Given the data sets below, plot or scatter both on the same set of axes. You are plotting the time it takes to execute a sorting algorithm on a list of a given size; your x axis should be the size, and the y axis is time. Assume that insertion_sort_times[i] is how long it took to sort a list of length sizes[i]. Add a legend to your plot showing which is insertion sort and which is merge sort. Use the variable names to determine which data is which.
